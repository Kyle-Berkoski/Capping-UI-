# Capping-UI-
Hello there!

If you are reading this, you are most likely the class working on this project.
Congratulations, first of all, if you are in Professor Algozine's class,
you are very lucky to have such a great professor.

Next thing is, get ready to work

This project, as im sure you know by now, is to create a web reporting system for the local CPCA
They have no online system and currently do everything by hand.

So, the main things we thought would be convient for them to have in this type of system would be, 
1. Searching for people in the system quickly
2. Taking attendance
3. Referring and intaking participants
4. Class scheduling and editing records in the system

I believe the project we ended up with is a pretty thorough sketch of what they need, 
but clearly needs more work and testing.

Oh right testing, make sure you do a lot of testing.
Make a test plan, make cases, comb through this system with fine tooth comb 
and make sure things do what they are suppose to do.

Also make sure when you are cleaning things up with secruity. This application
was built with the thought that it would never be a public facing website,
only to be used for intranet purposes. So if that changes, do things like sanitize inputs and data
to prevent things like SQL injections, make sure only people cleared for sensitive information can see certain pages, etc.

Anyway, I have taken the liberty during my last year here to provide some
clairvoyance into things that might have to change and some doucmentation on the pages.

Most of the pages have a comment at the first line explaining the basic funcitonality, and 
possible bugs or errors that might be present.

I would also consider redisgning these pages from a UX/UI perspective. I am not a designer, i picked the colors randomly from a color 
wheel, I am not a hip cool developer, so please change those things. But the UX could be changed up, because even people on my team
were confused sometimes as to features that we have implemented (yes you can take attendance it is just not straightfoward, its called report card). Consider streamlining the system so that someone with 0 iq could use it, because that is the ultimate goal of designing.

In regards to setting up the repo, I would abadon this current repo, and copy all the code and make a new repo. This github repo is under Kyle Berkoski, so make a new repo for your class.

Thats all I can think of right now.

Good luck
